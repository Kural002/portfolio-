                        <p class="card-text">I worked as a Flutter Developer Intern at Routebus, where I developed and
                            maintained features for their mobile application. My tasks included implementing new
                            features, optimizing app performance, and fixing bugs in the existing app. I used
                            <strong>Flutter</strong> and <strong>Firebase</strong> to create an efficient and
                            user-friendly app that enhances the commuter experience by providing real-time bus tracking,
                            route information, and notifications. I worked remotely and participated in regular online
                            team meetings and code reviews to ensure code quality and collaboration.
